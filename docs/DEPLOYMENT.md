# LifeOS Deployment

This document describes the verified standalone internal MVP deployment. It does not describe an App Store or TestFlight release.

## Architecture

```text
iPhone → Railway HTTPS API → Supabase Cloud
```

The installed iPhone application sends authenticated requests to the public Railway API. The API verifies the caller's Supabase JWT and accesses Supabase with the publishable key and caller identity, leaving Row Level Security responsible for data isolation. The application does not require or use `service_role`.

## Railway API service

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Service name | `lifeos-api` |
| Public URL | `https://lifeosapi-production-0362.up.railway.app` |
| Root Directory | `/` (repository root) |
| Build Command | `npm run build --workspace @lifeos/api` |
| Start Command | `npm run start --workspace @lifeos/api` |
| Production process | `node dist/src/server.js` |
| Healthcheck path | `/health` |

`GET /health` is unauthenticated and returns only the service name and status. Railway provides `PORT` at runtime; it must not be hard-coded.

### Railway environment variables

The API service requires these variable names:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `NODE_ENV`
- `PORT` — provided by Railway

`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is required only when approved browser clients need API access. Native React Native requests do not depend on browser CORS.

Values and secrets belong in the Railway service configuration or untracked local environment files. Local `.env` files, Supabase key values, passwords, and JWTs must never be committed.

## Mobile deployment environment

The deployment environment must set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to:

```text
https://lifeosapi-production-0362.up.railway.app
```

Mobile also needs its existing public Supabase configuration. Environment values remain untracked and must not be embedded in documentation or committed.

## Standalone iPhone Release build

With the intended deployment environment configured, connect the registered iPhone and run from the repository root:

```bash
npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release
```

The iOS bundle identifier is `il.co.ozavrahami.lifeos`.

The verified standalone test used the installed Release build with Metro stopped, the local API stopped, the Mac disconnected, and the iPhone on cellular networking. Normal use therefore does not require the Mac, Metro, or a LAN-hosted API.

## Distribution limitation

The current build is signed through the existing Apple Personal Team/development setup and is intended for internal use on registered devices. “Standalone” means the installed application can operate without development infrastructure; it does not mean the application has been released through TestFlight or the App Store.

Later TestFlight or App Store distribution will require an appropriate paid Apple Developer Program membership, App Store Connect application and signing/provisioning configuration, production release metadata and privacy declarations, archive/upload validation, and the applicable TestFlight review or App Review process. Those distribution steps are not complete in Phase 8.
